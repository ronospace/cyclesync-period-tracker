## 🔒 Important Security Notes

### Build Artifacts (.gitignore)
**The following are NOT committed to GitHub (security best practice):**
- `build/` directory (contains production builds)
- `android/app/google-services.json` (Firebase config)
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS Firebase config)
- `*.keystore` files (Android signing keys)
- `*.p12` files (iOS certificates)

### Sensitive Information
**Before public repository:**
- ✅ All API keys are properly configured in Firebase Console
- ✅ Debug prints and test data removed
- ✅ Production Firebase environment configured
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source code

## 🚀 Quick Push Commands

### For immediate push (all changes):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 CycleSync v1.0.0 - Production Ready

Complete menstrual cycle tracking app with AI insights.
Ready for Google Play Store and Apple App Store submission."
git push origin main
```

### Check push status:
```bash
git log --oneline -5    # View recent commits
git remote -v           # Verify remote repository
git status              # Check working directory status
```

## 📋 Post-Push Checklist

After pushing to GitHub:
- [ ] Verify all files uploaded correctly
- [ ] Check that sensitive files are properly gitignored  
- [ ] Update README.md with app description and screenshots
- [ ] Create GitHub release tag for v1.0.0
- [ ] Consider GitHub Actions for automated builds (future)

## 🎯 Production Deployment Status
